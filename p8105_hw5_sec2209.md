## Problem 2

      names_to = "week",
      names_prefix = "week",
      values_to = "observation"
    )
}

p2_df = p2_df %>%
  mutate(
    study_arm = ifelse(str_detect(file_name, "con"), "Control", "Experimental"),
    study_id = str_sub(file_name, 5, 6),
    data = map(str_c('./data/',file_name), import_csv)
    )
